1. First, you need to register two applications in Azure AD:

   a. For the React application:
   - Go to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App registrations
   - Click "New registration"
   - Name: "Auth Demo Client"
   - Supported account types: "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
   - Redirect URI: "Single-page application (SPA)" with value "http://localhost:5173"
   - After creation, note down the "Application (client) ID" and "Directory (tenant) ID"

   b. For the API:
   - Create another app registration
   - Name: "Auth Demo API"
   - Supported account types: "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
   - No redirect URI needed
   - After creation, note down the "Application (client) ID"
   - Go to "Expose an API"
   - Click "Add a scope"
   - Set scope name as "access_as_user"
   - Set admin consent display name and description
   - Set user consent display name and description
   - State: "Enabled"

2. Configure API permissions for the React application:
   - In the React app registration
   - Go to "API permissions"
   - Click "Add a permission"
   - Select "My APIs"
   - Select your API application
   - Select the "access_as_user" scope
   - Grant admin consent

3. Update the configuration files:

   a. In `client/src/authConfig.ts`:
   - Replace `your-client-id` with the React app's client ID
   - Replace `your-tenant-id` with your tenant ID
   - Replace `your-api-client-id` with the API's client ID

   b. In `api/appsettings.json`:
   - Replace `your-domain.onmicrosoft.com` with your Azure AD domain
   - Replace `your-tenant-id` with your tenant ID
   - Replace `your-api-client-id` with the API's client ID

4. Start both applications:

   For the API:
   ```powershell
   cd api
   dotnet run
   ```

   For the React app:
   ```powershell
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
